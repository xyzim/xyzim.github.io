<h3>Abstract</h3>

Current radio telescopes have reached technical limitations such that increased resolution can only be obtained through larger collection geometries. Interferometry between many small dishes offers this resolution without the exponential cost of large dish telescopes. Here we review the upgrade of Brookhaven's Stage I radio telescope to a four-dish interferometer. Correlated signals from the radio galaxy Cygnus A are modeled and collected data is analyzed for calibration and precise determination of dish position, time delay, pointing, and beam shape. This Stage I design development shall inform the planned Stage II 256 x 256 dish array designed to map the intensity of the redshifted 21 cm emission line from neutral hydrogen.
