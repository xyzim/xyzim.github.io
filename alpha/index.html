The Antihydrogen Laser Physics Apparatus (ALPHA) is an experiment based in Switzerland at CERN's Antiproton Decelerator (AD) Hall. By merging ultracold positron and antiproton plasmas, we create and trap hydrogen antiatoms which are then used for various laser spectroscopy experiments. CPT symmetry is tested through the precise comparison of the atomic spectra of antihydrogen and hydrogen.
<br><br>
ALPHA is the most accomplished experiment world-wide in the creation and study of antihydrogen. The collaboration was founded by former members of the ATHENA collaboration, who were the first to produce cold antihydrogen in 2002. ALPHA now holds records for the most neutral antihydrogen ever trapped at one time (over 1000 atoms) and the highest rates of antihydrogen production. ALPHA was the first to measure the 1S-2S transition as well as the Lyman-Alpha (1S-2P) transition in trapped antihydrogen. Additionally, we will soon publish results of the first demonstrated laser cooling of antihydrogen.
<br><br>
ALPHA is now preparing to measure the gravitational interaction of antihydrogen with its new generation trap, coined ALPHAg. Results are expected once antiprotons have been returned to the AD Hall in 2021 after the 2-year shutdown of CERN facilities.
