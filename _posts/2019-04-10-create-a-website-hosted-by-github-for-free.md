Hello world!

As my first blog post I'd like to share how I setup and hosted my website though Github for absolutely no cost. 


[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) lets you create a repository that let's you push changes and see them live at `https://username.github.io`. You can even use any custom domain you own. This is a perfect option for those in need of a personal website who aren't afraid of writing some html to do it. 

### What you will need to know:
1. Basics of HTML
2. How to use version control with git

If you haven't worked with html or git before, you'll probably want to check out some tutorials. Don't let this scare you. It's easier than you might think and you'll be learning a marketable skill. There's also a web interface so you won't have to touch the command line if you're not ready to.

### There are just three simple steps to create your own website with Github:

1. Create a Github account (remember your username will be in your url.)
2. Create a new repository named `username.github.io`.
3. Go live by creating your homepage with the filename `index.html`. Save this file in your home directory. 

Congrats, that's it! You can now start building your website. For fans of Markdown, check out [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to learn how to write your website in Markdown syntax.
